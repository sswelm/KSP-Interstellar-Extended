KSP Interstellar Extended: To The Stars And Beyond!
===============

Welcome to the Github repository for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) Interstellar Extended (KSPIE). KSPIE is a plugin for [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/), designed to encourage bootstrapping toward ever more advanced levels of technology as well as utilizing [In-Situ resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_resource_utilization) to expand the reach of Kerbal civilization.

The easiest way to install Interstellar is by using the [Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90246-*), which is available [here](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases).

Looking for release information? Please visit the [release thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173818-*) on the Kerbal Space Program forum.

For support with Interstellar extended, please see the [support thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/172026-*) for assistance. Additionally, there is information on the [wiki](https://github.com/sswelm/KSP-Interstellar-Extended/wiki). We would love to hear your suggestions on what can be done to make things easier to understand, and what problems that you're experiencing so that we make may the learning process more enjoyable for everyone.

Would you like to suggest a new feature, or the new developments? There's a
[development thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/161531-*) for that.

History and goals
-------

KSP Interstellar Extended aims to continue in Fractals original KSPI vision in providing a realistic road to the stars.

Players will first gain access to contemporary technologies that have not been widely applied to real space programs such as nuclear reactors, electrical generators and thermal rockets. By continuing down the [Community Tech Tree (CTT)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90530-*) and performing more research, these parts can be upgraded and later surpassed by novel new technologies such as fusion and even antimatter power.

We attempt to portray both the tremendous power of these technologies as well as their drawbacks, including the tremendous difficulty of obtaining resources like antimatter and the difficulties associated with storing it safely. The goal being to reward players who develop advanced infrastructure on other planets with new, novel and powerful technologies capable of helping Kerbals explore planets in new and exciting ways.

The principal goal of KSP Interstellar is to expand Kerbal Space Program with interesting technologies and to  provide a logical and compelling technological progression beginning with technologies that could have been available in the 1970s/1980s, then technologies that could be available within the next few years, progressing to technologies that may not be available for many decades, all the way out to speculative technologies that are physically reasonably but may or may not ever be realizable in practice.
