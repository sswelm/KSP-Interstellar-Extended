Version 1.6  (2017-07-12)
* Add "atmosphere tracker" that shows a message when you're imminently about to enter or leave atmosphere.


Version 1.5.4  (2017-05-28)
* Update default countdown dots for KSP 1.3 compatibility (1.3 broke the fonts)

* BROKEN VERSION, DO NOT USE.  Navball is hopelessly mangled whenever impact tracker or closest-approach tracker is active.
* Fix a bug that spams an error message "Parent of RectTransform is being set with parent property." when the mod starts up. (Thanks to DMagic for catching!)

* Fixed a bug that caused BBT to spam NullReferenceException when impact-tracking a vessel that has a kerbal in a command chair.
* Added BetterBurnTimeData as a public API for the mod.
* Added sample code in new "example" github directory, illustrating how to use it.


Version 1.5  (2016-10-11)
