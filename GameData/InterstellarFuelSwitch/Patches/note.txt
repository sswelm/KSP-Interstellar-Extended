stock has 1:8 rocket fuel mass ratio
I think the tank mass should be between about 1/2 of what it is in stock.
Or balance the new mass so benchmark rocket would have same dV with kerlox as with stock.
The benchmark rocket as 4563 vac dV stock. lfo 1:8 0.25t

Realism holes:
  - tank plumbing can be rewired in flight
    - but, docking port already connects all resources in the vessel
  - the common bulkhead "moves" when shitching tanks in flight

Specialized, tanks
  - liquid tanks without insulation and liquifiers
    - have higher mass ratio

Tanks missing config (probably):
Hex segments
hex core
  - do not forget to remove fuel jetisson (is in framework)
