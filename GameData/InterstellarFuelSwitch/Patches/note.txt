stock has 1:8 rocket fuel mass ratio
I think the tank mass should be between 1/2-1/4 of what it is in stock.
Or balance the new mass so benchmark rocket would have same dV with kerlox as with stock.
The benchmark rocket as 4563 vac dV.
new: 4639

Realism holes:
  - tank plumbing can be rewired in flight
    - but, docking port already connects all resources in the vessel
  - the common bulkhead "moves" when shitching tanks in flight

Specialized, tanks
  - liquid tanks without insulation and liquifiers
    - have higher mass ratio
