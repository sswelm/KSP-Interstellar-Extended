Situation Module Info

This simple plugin adds additional info about science experiment to its information panel (RightMouseClick). 
Now you can find info about situation when experiment will work and its relations from biomes while constructing 
your vessel in VAB. Also it adds usage requirements and can trace multiple experiments definitions in one part. 

Works in VAB-SPH only.
