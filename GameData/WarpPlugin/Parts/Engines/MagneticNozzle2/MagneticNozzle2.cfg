title = Plasma Nozzle
manufacturer = Ionic Protonic Electronics
description = The plasma nozzle is an advanced alternative to the thermal rocket which can expel high temperature charged exhaust at extremely high velocities because the propellant is confined electromagnetically instead of physically.  It does require electric power and, of of course, only operates when paired with reactors that generate charged particles. Not rated for atmospheric use.
