description = The Daedalus propulsion system is an engine that utilises laser induced inertial fusion for propulsion.  Pellets of Deuterium and Helium3 are compressed to ultra-high densities using a high power ion gun.  The crew onboard are shielded by the engine from the intense neutron flux of the fusion reaction but because the reaction occurs outside the ship, other nearby vessels aren't so protected - Beware!
