    description = The Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (LC/MS) is a device that separates liquid components chemically via a liquid chromatograph and then feeds the result into a mass spectrometer, which measures the molecular weight of each chemical. As a result, it can separate, identify, and quantify a large number of different chemicals.  It can be used to analyse the constituents of planetary oceans.
