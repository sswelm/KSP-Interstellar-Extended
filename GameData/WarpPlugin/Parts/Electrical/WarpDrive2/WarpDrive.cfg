	description = #LOC_KSPIE_KspiWarpDrive_descr	// #LOC_KSPIE_KspiWarpDrive_descr = Originally designed by Zefram Kerman himself, this piece of technology sneakily evades relativity's prohibition on faster than light travel by translating a small bubble of spacetime across space, at faster than light speeds, while imparting no actual momentum change to the vessel. Large amounts of energy are required to charge the warp drive with Exotic Matter and initiate warp, with the energy requirements increasing the closer the vessel is to the gravity well of a celestial body. Since it was designed by Zefram Kerman, it may not function without the application of rock music.
