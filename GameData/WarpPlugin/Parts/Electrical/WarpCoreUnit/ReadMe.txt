SpannerMonkey created this model for me from a warpcore model I found on blendswap, and derived a config for it following the configs for
Alcubierre Warp Drive (Stand-alone) By RoverDude. which is a dependancy for this mod.

I have heavily modified the config to run on it's own resource, Dilithium Crystal (of course), provide it's own power (850 ec/s), power 
storage (1000 ElectricCharge) and provide a way to replenish the Dilithium Crystal from processing ore at a rate of 1 Dilithium Crystal 
per every 10 ore, every 10 sec.

This warp core is a little cheaty compared to the other warp drives out there, because of it's size... and yes, I know... no warp nacelles.

I was fed up building warp capable ships and having to use enourmous warp drives, I wanted something I could fit inside a large cargo bay, 
and well, here it is!

This Warp Core is a fully self contained warp drive, reactor and ore processor. In order to make use of the reactor and ore processing, 
first you must "Deploy the Converter" wait for it to be ready (it takes a little while), start the reactor, Initialize the Dilithium Chamber, 
and if you are converting ore into Dilithium Crystal, Start Crystal Extraction.

The ore processing requires exactly 99% of the reactors power output, leaving you with a very small output of 8.5 ec/s to maintain minimal 
ship fumctions. Do not attempt to run the ore processor and the engine at the same time unless you have a rather large secondary power source.

In order to create a "Warp Bubble", you must be a minimum of 90km above the surface... then buckle up and engage!
