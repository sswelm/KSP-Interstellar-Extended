description = #LOC_KSPIE_LargeElectricGenerator_descr  // #LOC_KSPIE_LargeElectricGenerator_descr = A Charged Particle Direct Power Converter is a type of Electric Generator engine that convert charged particles produced by a reactor, directly into electrical power using Periodic Electrostatic Focusing Converter. It needs to be connected directly to a reactor able to prodece charged particles. Initially it will allow you to convert charged particles at a flat efficiency of 70%, independent of wasteheat ratio. Unlocking more advanced electric technology allows improved performance up to 95% efficiency significantly reducing the amount of produced wasteheat. Note that some reactors types already have a build in Direct Charged Article Converter like the Tri Alpha and therefore do not benefit from this power converter.
