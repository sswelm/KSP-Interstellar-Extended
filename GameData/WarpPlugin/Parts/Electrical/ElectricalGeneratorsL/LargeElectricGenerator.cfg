	description = #LOC_KSPIE_LargeElectricGenerator_descr  // #LOC_KSPIE_LargeElectricGenerator_descr = A Charged Particle Direct Power Converter extracts Megajoule energy from charged particles, and must be directly attached to a reactor that produces Charged Particles to function. Energy can be converted independently of the radiator heat sink temperature, allowing much higher efficiencies of 70% with fewer radiators required. Advanced electric technology upgrades improve its performance up to 95% efficiency, significantly reducing waste heat production. Some reactors such as the Tri-Alpha Colliding Beam already integrate this generator to save mass and will not benefit from another Direct Conversion generator. Only one direct energy converter can be used per reactor.
