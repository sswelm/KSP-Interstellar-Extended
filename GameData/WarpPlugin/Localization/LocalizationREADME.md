  If you feel that you can translate KSPIE into your language and wish to do so, please contact @sswelm first. After doing so, create a new file in each folder titled Localization with your language's name in KSP (A full list can be seen at https://github.com/zer0Kerbal/Notes/blob/master/GameData/Notes/Localization/readme.md), then copy everything in the associated en-us.cfg to that file. KSPIE localization has many sections, split between the working plugin, WarpPlugin, Resources (within the primary mod of KSPIE), Interstellar Fuel Switch, Intersteller Hybrid Rocketry, and KSPIE's entries in the	Community Tech Tree. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact @sswelm - and, if you find a bug while translating, please create an issue.
