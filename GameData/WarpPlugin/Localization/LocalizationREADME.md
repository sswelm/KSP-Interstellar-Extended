  If you feel that you could translate KSPIE into your language, please contact @sswelm first, and create a new file in those folders called Localization with your language's name in KSP, then copy everything in en-us.cfg to that file. KSPIE localization has many sections, split between the working plugin, WarpPlugin, Resources (within the primary mod of KSPIE), Interstellar Fuel Switch, Intersteller Hybrid Rocketry, and KSPIE's entries in the	Community Tech Tree. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact @sswelm - and, if you find a bug while translating, please create an issue.
