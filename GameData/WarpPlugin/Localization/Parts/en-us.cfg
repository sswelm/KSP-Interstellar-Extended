		#LOC_KSPIE_AntimatterCollector_title = Antimatter Collector
		#LOC_KSPIE_AntimatterCollector_manuf = Zefram Kerman's Warp Supplies Co.
		#LOC_KSPIE_AntimatterCollector_descr = Harvests antimatter from planetary magnetospheres.  The rate at which antimatter acquisition occurs is dependent upon the magnetic field strength of the planet in question.
		#LOC_KSPIE_TweakableAntimatterReactor_title = Beamed Core Antimatter Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_TweakableAntimatterReactor_manuf = Zefram Kerman's Warp Supplies Co.
		#LOC_KSPIE_TweakableAntimatterReactor_descr = In a Beam Core Antimatter Reactor a stream of Protons and Antiprotons collide creating a collection if charged and uncharged pions. The uncharged pions are unaffected by magnetic fields and fly off, almost immediately decaying into high energenic gamma rays. The charged poins can be used by a magnetic nozzle for propulsion or can be converted directly into electric power by a charhed particle power converter. The fuel source can be either Antimatter or AntiHydrogen.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FNFissionFusionCatReactorMk1_title = Antimatter Initiated Micro Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_FNFissionFusionCatReactorMk1_manuf = Geomax Plc.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FNFissionFusionCatReactorMk1_descr = An Antimatter Initiated Fission/Fusion Reactor that uses small quantities of antiprotons to produce fission in Uranium nuclei which in turn provide the energy to ignite fusion in a Deuterium/Helium-3 pellet.  The reactor contains the antiprotons magnetically and electrostatically in a vacuum.  This requires fewer bulky components compared to Tokomak designs but does require a healthy supply of antimatter to operate for long periods.
		#LOC_KSPIE_DPFFReactor_title = Dusty Plasma Fission Fragment Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_DPFFReactor_manuf = Radiant Future Enterprises
		#LOC_KSPIE_DPFFReactor_descr = The Dusty Plasma fission-fragment rocket is a rocket engine design that directly harnesses hot nuclear fission products for thrust, as opposed to using a separate fluid as working mass. The design can, in theory, produce very high specific impulse while still being well within the abilities of current technologies. The reactor is a Dusty Plasma design capable of producing a high proportion of its power as charged particles. To use for propulsion, connect the reactor to a Magnetic Nozzle and a thermal electric generator to produce the electricity to power the Magnetic nozzle magnets.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FIRGaCo_title = Open Cycle Gas Core Fission Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_FIRGaCo_manuf = Radiant Future Enterpirses
		#LOC_KSPIE_FIRGaCo_descr = The Open Cycle Gas Core reactor generates high amount of thermal power at double the core temperatures of the Closed Cycle predecessor, with less mass. This is achieved by removing the walls that separate the propellant and the nuclear fuel. Although this allows much higher core temperatures, the disadvantage is that the reactor cannot operate while under the influence of acceleration, which happens when it is either on the surface or when accelerating at high speed.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FutureFusionReactor_title = IXS Magnetic Confinement Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_FutureFusionReactor_manuf = WarpTech Industries
		#LOC_KSPIE_FutureFusionReactor_descr = Advanced Fusion Reactor with integrated Direct Energy Converter.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiIXSWarpRing_title = Alcubierre Drive (Heavy)
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiIXSWarpRing_manuf = WarpTech Industries
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiIXSWarpRing_descr = As the WarpTech marketing department says, "Why go places, when you can bring places to you?" Before engaging the drive, make sure to have a good supply of Warp Plasma, as well as a large amount of electricity.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMagTar_title = Magnetized Target Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMagTar_manuf = Radiant Future Enterpirses
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMagTar_descr = Magnetised Target Fusion Reactor can be smaller than the MCF reactor, but it is limited to providing thermal power. This makes it ideal for building SSTO vessels which require large amount of thermal heat to generate thrust when connected with any thermal nozzle. It can also be used for Electric Power production, but it requires a large amount of radiators to be effective.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoSt_title = Stellarator Fusion Reactor 
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoSt_manuf = Radiant Future Enterpirses
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoSt_descr = The stellarator is an advanced magnetic containment fusion reactor which is heavier but more efficient than the Spherical Tokamak. Similarly to tokamak designs, this reactor contains a (hopefully) controlled nuclear fusion reaction inside a magnetic field. However, the stellarator is of a figure-eight geometry that allows the magnetic containment to more effectively counteract drift of the particles in the containment field. All those weirdly shaped magnets mean that it's got a bit more mass to it and as such it is best suited for powering beam-powered networks from surface or stationary orbits. This design has been pioneered by Spitzer Kerman, who claims that his invention was definitely NOT an accidental squishing of a regular tokamak reactor, honest.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoTo_title = MFC Spherical Tokamak
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoTo_manuf = Radiant Future Enterpirses
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoTo_descr = The Sperical Tokamak Magnetic Confinement Fusion Reactor is one of the first Fusion Power reactors and comes available with Fusion Power. This reactor is big, bulky and requires a fixed amount of power to operate - but it can be used for a wide variety of purposes. The amount of power required depends on the type of fusion and the number of researched fusion technology science nodes. MCF is most suitable for fuel efficient and thermal efficient power production. One of the big advantages of fusion is that its fuel can be very cheap, relatively easy to store and has only low amounts of radioactive waste products. The fusion products themselves can be directly converted into electric power, which allows the reactor to be very energy efficient. Initial Minimum Size is 5 m, but after advanced fusion, it can be scaled down to 3.75 diameter, and with exotic fusion to 2.5 diameter.
		#LOC_KSPIE_MHDGenerator_title = Magnetohydrodynamic Electric Generator
		#LOC_KSPIE_MHDGenerator_manuf = Brayton Kerman's Power Parts Inc.
		#LOC_KSPIE_MHDGenerator_descr = A Direct Conversion Generator that turns charged particles into electrical power.
		#LOC_KSPIE_MoltenSaltReactor_title = Molten Salt Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_MoltenSaltReactor_manuf = Kerbin Electric Inc.
		#LOC_KSPIE_MoltenSaltReactor_descr = Molten Salt Fission Reactors have the lowest temperature and thermal power of all the reactors, but these drawbacks are balanced out with their long-lasting stores of UF4 or ThF4. This fission reactor can last a very long time without refueling. The actinide waste can also be reprocessed using a refinery or a science lab to vastly increase their lifespan, and the reactors can even be refueled to extend it indefinitely. The fission reaction requires a minimum power level to sustain itself, and so these reactors cannot go below 20% power production unless they are shut off.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiPebbleBed_title = Pebble Bed Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiPebbleBed_manuf = Radiant Future Enterprises
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiPebbleBed_descr = Part of a new series of fission reactors with slightly different capabilities.  The flagship "Akula" reactor provides tremendous power output, which operates up to potentially higher temperatures than Molten Salt designs but has a power output that is inversely related to temperature.
		#LOC_KSPIE_PlasmaJetMagnetoInertialReactor_title = Plasma Jet Magneto Inertial Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_PlasmaJetMagnetoInertialReactor_manuf = Radiant Future Enterpirses
		#LOC_KSPIE_PlasmaJetMagnetoInertialReactor_descr = Magnetised Target Fusion Reactor can be smaller than the MCF reactor, but it is limited to providing thermal power. This makes it ideal for building SSTO vessels which require large amount of thermal heat to generate thrust when connected with any thermal nozzle. It can also be used for Electric Power production, but it requires a large amount of radiators to be effective.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiQuantumSingulaityReactor2_title = DT-R-QS-1 Quantum Singularity Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiQuantumSingulaityReactor2_manuf = DragonTek
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiQuantumSingulaityReactor2_descr = The ultimate in power generation. The artificial black hole is generated by accelerating exotic matter in rings that are magnetically suspended inside the reactor core. A Quantum Singularity Reactor uses a microscopic black hole to convert matter into energy. The lighter the atoms that are used, the more efficiently matter can be converted into energy. In order to start the reactor, provide it with a large amount of electrical power, in a zero-G environment (in orbit) and preferably near a gravity well (planet).
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiQuantumSingulaityReactor2_tags = quantum singularity reactor blackhole energy
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiTriAlphaFusionReactor_title = Tri Alpha Colliding Beam Fusion Reactor
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiTriAlphaFusionReactor_manuf = Keridian Dynamics
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiTriAlphaFusionReactor_descr = The Tri Alpha Colliding Beam Fusion Reactor is the first fusion reactor capable of operating in aneutronic fusion mode and thanks to its integrated direct energy converter can operate at high efficiencies. This will be ideal for electric propulsion where waste heat should be minimised. This comes however at the cost of flexibility, as the reactor will not be able to connect with any thermal or magnetic nozzles and can only run with aneutronic fusion fuels.
		#LOC_KSPIE_WarpDrive_title = Alcubierre Drive (Light) 
		#LOC_KSPIE_WarpDrive_manuf = Zefram Kerman's Warp Supplies Co.
		#LOC_KSPIE_WarpDrive_descr = Originally designed by Zefram Kerman himself, this piece of technology is designed to sneakily evade the prohibition of faster than light travel described by the theory of relativity by translating a small subset of spacetime across space at unbelievable speeds while imparting no momentum change to the vessel at all.  Since it was designed by Zefram Kerman, it may not function without the application of rock music.

		#LOC_KSPIE_AluminiumHybrid1_manuf = Jebediah Kerman's Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co.
		#LOC_KSPIE_AluminiumHybrid1_descr = A hybrid rocket uses a combination of solid fuel and liquid oxidiser.  It has better performance than a solid rocket and is more controllable but still performs poorly compared to liquid rockets.  The solid fuel in this version is aluminium, which is easily extracted from regolith.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FNSmallAugmentedArcjet_title = ATTILA Thruster
		#LOC_KSPIE_FNSmallAugmentedArcjet_manuf = Ionic Protonic Electronics
		#LOC_KSPIE_FNSmallAugmentedArcjet_descr = The ATTILA (Adjustable Throttle Inductively Afterburning Arcjet) is a type of augmented arcjet that uses magnetic induction to enhance the thrust produced from a typical arcjet.  For an electric rocket, it has low exhaust velocity but it does provide superior thrust performance as a result.
		#LOC_KSPIE_DeadlusEngine_title = Daedalus
		#LOC_KSPIE_DeadlusEngine_manuf = Kerbal Ignition Facility Junkyard Co.
		#LOC_KSPIE_DeadlusEngine_descr = The Daedalus propulsion system is an engine that utilises laser induced inertial fusion for propulsion.  Pellets of Deuterium and Helium3 are compressed to ultra-high densities using a high power ion gun.  The crew onboard are shielded by the engine from the intense neutron flux of the fusion reaction but because the reaction occurs outside the ship, other nearby vessels aren't so protected - Beware!
		#LOC_KSPIE_DeadlusEngine_cname = FusionPellets manufacturer
		#LOC_KSPIE_DeadlusEngine_cstar = Start create FusionPellets
		#LOC_KSPIE_DeadlusEngine_cstop = Stop create FusionPellets
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiEmDrive_title = EM Drive
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiEmDrive_manuf = SpaceMouse Industries
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiEmDrive_descr = They LAUGHED at the concept of a reaction-less drive, up until our orbit continued increasing with not a drop of rocket-fuel on board. According to ISP Electronics sales reps, the rumours of this engine being powered by "dark magic" are largely exaggerated, although unlike a Electric Xenon thruster the physics behind thrust with no reaction mass are poorly understood.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiDuelMountedArcjet45_title = Mounted Dual Arcjet RCS 45

		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiNuclearCandle_descr = Take an RTG, and pump fuel through the hot radioactive core into a nozzle. The result is a very small nuclear rocket engine. Thrust is low, but probes won't mind. Waste Heat Rating: 400
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiEpstein_title = Kerbstein Fusion Engine
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiEpstein_manuf = Duna Ignition Junkyard and Lethal Experiment Co.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiEpstein_descr = The Kerbstein propulsion system is the (late) Kerbstein Kerman's 'accidental' modification to the existing Vista Engine. This propulsion system utilises laser induced inertial fusion for propulsion, with upgrades combining both a thermal and plasma engine.  Pellets of Deuterium and Lithium6 are compressed to ultra-high densities using a high power laser.  By default it will use maximum available power but this can be changed in the settings. While this engine utilizes aneutronic fusion it does still produce a large amount of gamma rays, so beware when thrusting near other ships and unprotected kerbals.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiEpstein2_title = Kerbstein Fusion Engine
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiEpstein2_manuf = Duna Ignition Junkyard and Lethal Experiment Co.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiEpstein2_descr = The Kerbstein propulsion system is the (late) Kerbstein Kerman's 'accidental' modification to the existing Vista Engine. This propulsion system utilises laser induced inertial fusion for propulsion, with upgrades combining both a thermal and plasma engine. Pellets of LithiumHydride are compressed to ultra-high densities using a high power laser.  By default it will use maximum available power but this can be changed in the settings. While this engine utilizes aneutronic fusion it does still produce a large amount of gamma rays, so beware when thrusting near other ships and unprotected kerbals. Also note that in order to achieve inertial fusion, it can only operate in vacuum of space.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiLANTR_title = Solid Core Nuclear Engine
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiLANTR_manuf = PorkWorks
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiLANTR_descr = A more compact and lightweight Nuclear Thermal Rocket design. Hot Feature: LOX-Augmented Afterburner mode - Oxidizer is injected directly into the nozzle where it violently reacts with the superheated plasma exhaust and causes a massive increase in thrust, at the cost of a lower ISP.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiNuclearJetEngine_title = Direct Cycle Nuclear Turbojet
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiNuclearJetEngine_manuf = PorkWorks
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiNuclearJetEngine_descr = Similar to a chemical Turbojet, except the combustion chamber has been replaced by a nuclear reactor heating the air and driving the turbine. Since it does not rely on chemical combustion, flight time is unlimited and the engine will work in oxygenless atmospheres. The only downside is the mass added by the heavy reactor shielding. It includes a built-in precooler and air intakes.

		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiLightbulb_title = Closed Cycle Gas Core Engine
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiLightbulb_manuf = PorkWorks
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiLightbulb_descr = The Closed Cycle Gas-Core engine a.k.a Lightbulb overcomes the limits of solid core NTRs by deliberately letting the reactor melt and vaporize, reaching much higher core temperatures and exhaust velocities, which grants this rocket an enormous ISP of 1500s. No radioactive material leaves the engine though, the vaporized nuclear hellfire is safely confined within seven astonishingly fragile transparent quartz bulbs, which let most of the thermal radiation through to the propellant and are the reason for its lovely name. A sophisticated system of active cooling and a steady vortex stream of inert gas around the fissioning nuclear plasma that keeps it from touching the walls prevent the quartz bulbs from spontaneously vaporizing. Actually yes, it does sound kind of scary, but as with everything in life, the coolness of things is proportional to their danger. Waste Heat Rating: 2000
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiLightbulb_InterstellarFissionPBDP_origi = Nuclear Lightbulb
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiLightbulb_InterstellarFissionPBDP_upgra = Nuclear Lightbulb

		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMagneticNozzle_title = Plasma Nozzle
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMagneticNozzle_manuf = Ionic Protonic Electronics
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMagneticNozzle_descr = The plasma nozzle is an advanced alternative to the thermal rocket which can expel high temperature charged exhaust at extremely high velocities because the propellant is confined electromagnetically instead of physically.  It does require electric power and, of of course, only operates when paired with reactors that generate charged particles. Not rated for atmospheric use.

		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMagneticNozzle_upgrade_title = Plasma Nozzle Upgrade

		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMagneticNozzle3_manuf = Ionic Protonic Electronics
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMagneticNozzle3_descr = The magnetic nozzle is an advanced alternative to the thermal rocket which can expel high temperature charged exhaust at extremely high velocities because the propellant is confined electromagnetically instead of physically.

		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMIFEngine_title = Magneto Inertial Fusion Engine
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMIFEngine_manuf = Ark Propulsions
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMIFEngine_descr = Magneto Inertial Fusion (MIF) describes a class of fusion devices which combine aspects of magnetic confinement fusion and inertial confinement fusion in an attempt to lower the cost of fusion devices. MIF uses magnetic fields to confine an initially warm, low-density plasma, then compresses that plasma to fusion conditions using an impulsive driver or "liner." This reactor cannot produce any electric power, instead it requires a relatively small amount of megajoule power, but far less than a pure electric engine would. Basically this engine is a power multiplier. It converts electric power into a high amount of thrust power. Because Magneto Inertial Fusion (MIF) is a hybrid between fusion and electric propulsion technology it benefits from both technologies. Due to its low power requirements, this engine can be powered by a small/inefficient nuclear reactor or by large amounts of solar arrays or beamed power.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMIFEngine_upgrade_title = Magneto Inertial Fusion Engine Upgrade
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMIFEngine_upgrade_descr = When unlocked, will improve power and efficiency of Magneto Inertial Fusion Engine.

		#LOC_KSPIE_InterstellarPlasmaThruster_manuf = Ionic Protonic Electronics
		#LOC_KSPIE_InterstellarPlasmaThruster_descr = A larger and more efficient cousin of the ion engine, it is best not to attempt to power this engine with witchcraft and instead opt for a very large electric generator.

		#LOC_KSPIE_InterstellarRcs5block_descr = Despite widespread belief to the contrary, it appears to be completely possible to build monopropellant valves small enough, that a 5-way thruster block is possible within a small manageable housing. True story!

		#LOC_KSPIE_InterstellarRcsCorner_manuf = Modular Rocket Systems
		#LOC_KSPIE_InterstellarRcsCorner_descr = What do quantum mechanics have to do with RCS thruster blocks? Absolutely nothing! Guaranteed to contain no quantum components. These RCS thrusters are angled to allow use on the diagonal "corner" positions of your vehicle, and still thrust efficiently in the direction you are steering.
		#LOC_KSPIE_TRN23_title = Thermal Rocket Nozzle 23 "Krusader"
		#LOC_KSPIE_TRN23_manuf = Radiant Future Enterprises
		#LOC_KSPIE_TRN23_descr = A special purpose thermal rocket nozzle specialised for atmospheric Launches. Unlike a more conventional chemical rocket, this thermal rocket features a heat exchanger used to derive its propulsive power directly from a reactor.  It must therefore be attached directly to a reactor in order to achieve any thrust.  The thrust and specific impulse available are determined by the reactor it is attached to.
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiNuclearRamjet_title = TORY Nuclear Ramjet Engine
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiNuclearRamjet_manuf = C7 Aerospace Division
		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiNuclearRamjet_descr = "Tory" is a Nuclear Ram-Jet, using an unshielded nuclear reactor to heat incoming air. While it does not require fuel, it will need boosting to a suitable velocity before becoming effective. Despite being the result of many years of very expensive research; we're not entirely certain of the side-effects of using the engine, as every scientist on the project has since turned a slightly more luminescent shade of green and expired.

		#LOC_KSPIE_BPDLA_descr = The Diode Laser Array uses MegaJoule energy to produce a laser beams. After several laser-labs burnt down in the attempt to build ever larger diode lasers, the famous Theodore Kerman came up with the idea to simply bundle multiple small laser beams to achieve high power beams. Nonetheless, a lot of laser-labs still burn down each year due to the nature of Kerbals. A Diode Laser Array is required in order to transmit in the infrared or visible spectrum. The Diode Laser Array transmission wavelength can only be configured in the VAB.
