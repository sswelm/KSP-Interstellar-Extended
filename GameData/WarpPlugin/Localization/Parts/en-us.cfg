		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiBlanketRectenna_descr = This receiver specializes at efficiently receiving beamed power and converting it directly to electrical power. However, its very narrow reception bandwidth can only be configured before launch. Transmission capabilities and the ability to retract were also sacrificed to lower its mass.

		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiSolarBlanket_descr = This enormous photovoltaic solar power receiver weighs less than blanket thermal receivers, but is less efficient at frequencies outside the near infrared spectrum.

The continuous mixing instantly thermalizes the fusion products, making it impossible to separate the charged particles for direct conversion generators or magnetic propulsion. The extra, unusually shaped magnets greatly increase the stellarator's mass, making it better for stationary applications like beam-powered networks. Some energy is still required to sustain fusion, so the reactor should be directly connected to a thermal power generator or preferably magnetohydrodynamic power generator.

However, these improvements were not enough to prevent a recent copystrike from the designers of the Magnetized Target Fusion Reactor, leading to the unwieldy "PJMIF" moniker.

No radioactive material leaves the engine though, as the vaporized nuclear hellfire is safely confined within seven astonishingly fragile transparent quartz bulbs, which transmit the thermal radiation into the propellant and are the reason for the engine's lovely name. A sophisticated active cooling system around the fissioning nuclear plasma that keeps it from touching the walls prevents the quartz bulbs from spontaneously vaporizing.

A rotating solid cylinder contains the fuel inside a high-temperature fluid with a higher molecular mass than the propellant, where the induced centripetal force pushes the core towards the outer wall. The inner cylindrical wall naturally melts at the high temperatures, but cooling on the outside of the cylinder ensures that the fuel does not melt through.

		#LOC_KSPIE_KspiMIFEngine_descr = Magneto Inertial Fusion (MIF) combines aspects of magnetic confinement fusion and inertial confinement fusion, in an attempt to lower the cost of fusion engines. MIF uses magnetic fields to confine an initially warm, low-density plasma, then compresses that plasma into fusion conditions using an impulsive driver or "liner." This engine requires a relatively small amount of Megajoule power to operate, but far less than a pure electric engine, and serves as a power multiplier to generate large amounts of thrust from even small fission reactors or beamed power.

It can use several neutral and reducing monopropellants, depending on the number of unlocked fuel technologies, and integrates a small thermal electric generator. This engine takes time to spool thrust up or down, so make sure to throttle up in advance to avoid unintended lithobraking.

Unlike a more conventional chemical engine, this nozzle features a heat exchanger used to derive energy directly from a reactor's thermal power. The thrust and specific impulse are determined by the core temperature and power output of the attached reactor, which must be directly attached to this engine. Fewer radiators are needed than electrical propulsion, as much of the reactor's thermal energy is expelled with the hot propellant and not turned into waste heat.
