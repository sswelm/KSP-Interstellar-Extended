		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoSt_title = Stellarator Fusion Reactor 
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoSt_descr = The stellarator is a advanced magnetic containment fusion reactor which is havier but it is easier to create and maintain fusion than the Spherical Tokamak. Similarly to tokamak designs, this reactor contains a (hopefully) controlled nuclear fusion reaction inside a magnetic field. However, the stellarator is of a figure-eight geometry that allows the magnetic containment to more effectively counteract drift of the particles in the containment field. The rotation of the particles was introduced by placing a new set of magnetic coils on the half-torus on either end, the corkscrew windings. The field from these coils mixes with the original confinement fields to produce a mixed field that rotates the lines of force through 180 degrees. Allthough the mixed field makes field containment easier, because any fusion charged particles get instantly thermalized, it makes it unsuitable for converting fusion charged particles directly into electric power. Another disadvantage of all those weirdly shaped magnets mean that it's got more mass to it and as such it is best suited for powering beam-powered networks from surface or stationary orbits.
		#LOC_KSPIE_FURMaCoSt2_descr = The Stellarator is similar to the Tokamak a magnetic containment fusion reactor which is heavier, limited to thermal and plasma production  but it is twice as easy to sustain a fusion plasma. The basic concept is to lay out the magnetic fields so that particles circulating around the long axis of the machine follow twisting paths, which cancels out instabilities seen in purely toroidal machines. This particular Stellarator is of a figure-eight geometry that allows the magnetic containment to more effectively counteract drift of the particles in the containment field. This would keep the fuel confined long enough to allow it to be heated to the point where fusion would take place. The rotation of the particles was introduced by placing a new set of magnetic coils on the half-torus on either end, the corkscrew windings. The field from these coils mixes with the original confinement fields to produce a mixed field that rotates the lines of force through 180 degrees. Although the mixed field makes field containment easier, as a result for continuous mixing, any fusion charged particles would instantly get thermalized with the fusion plasma, making it unsuitable for charged particles power generation or magnetic nozzle propulsion. Another disadvantage of all those weirdly shaped magnets mean that it's got more mass to it and as such it is best suited for powering beam-powered networks from surface or stationary orbits. In order to make the fusion process self-sustaining, you need to connect the reactor directly to a thermal power generator or preferably MHD power generator.

This reactor is big, bulky and requires a fixed amount of power to operate - but it can be used for a wide variety of purposes. The amount of power required depends on the type of fusion and the number of researched fusion technology science nodes. MCF is most suitable for fuel efficient and thermal efficient power production. One of the big advantages of fusion is that its fuel can be very cheap, relatively easy to store and has only low amounts of radioactive waste products. The fusion products themselves can be directly converted into electric power, which allows the reactor to be very energy efficient. Initial Minimum Size is 5 m, but after advanced fusion, it can be scaled down to 3.75 diameter, and with exotic fusion to 2.5 diameter.

		#LOC_KSPIE_OpenCycleGasCoreRocket_title = Open Cycle Gas Core Engine
		#LOC_KSPIE_OpenCycleGasCoreRocket_descr = Nuclear Open Cycle Gas Core Reactor rockets can provide much higher specific impulse than solid core nuclear rockets because their temperature limitations are in the nozzle and core wall structural temperatures, which are distanced from the hottest regions of the gas core. Consequently, nuclear gas core reactors can provide much higher temperatures to the propellant. Solid core nuclear thermal rockets can develop higher specific impulse than conventional chemical rockets due to the extreme power density of the reactor core, but their operating temperatures are limited by the maximum temperature of the solid core because the reactor's temperatures cannot rise above its components' lowest melting temperature.  Due to the much higher temperatures achievable by the gaseous core design, it can deliver higher specific impulse and thrust than most other conventional nuclear designs.

No radioactive material leaves the engine though, the vaporized nuclear hellfire is safely confined within seven astonishingly fragile transparent quartz bulbs, which let most of the thermal radiation through to the propellant and are the reason for its lovely name. A sophisticated system of active cooling and a steady vortex stream of inert gas around the fissioning nuclear plasma that keeps it from touching the walls prevent the quartz bulbs from spontaneously vaporizing. Actually yes, it does sound kind of scary, but as with everything in life, the coolness of things is proportional to their danger.

		#LOC_KSPIE_LiquidCoreEngine_title = Liquid Core Reactor Engine
		#LOC_KSPIE_LiquidCoreEngine_descr = Liquid Core Reactor Engines are in many way similar to an Open Cycle Nuclear Gas Core, but the fissionable core is merely molten, not gaseous. A dense high temperature fluid contains the fissionable material, and the hydrogen propellant is bubbled through to be heated. The propellant will be raised to a temperature somewhere between the melting and boiling point of the fluid. A liquid-core engine involves a rotating solid cylinder which is used to contain the fuel at a higher temperature. The induced centripetal force causes the fuel, which is of a higher molecular mass than the propellant, to the cylindrical wall. As the fuel melts and rises to temperatures above the melting point of the cylinder, the inner cylindrical wall naturally melts. The twist to this engine lies in the centripetal force which keeps the molten layer intact. Additionally, coolants running on the outside of the cylinder ensure that the entire cylinder does not melt through. The fuel is therefore able to be brought to a higher temperature than that in a solid core, and the propellant expelled with a greater force. Liquid-core engines can attain a much higher specific impulse of 1600s.

This reactor cannot produce any electric power, instead it requires a relatively small amount of megajoule power, but far less than a pure electric engine would. Basically this engine is a power multiplier. It converts electric power into a high amount of thrust power.
