        #LOC_KSPIE_extremeReactions_title = Extreme Density Fusion Reactions
        #LOC_KSPIE_extremeReactions_description = Measure and apply yet more complex fusion reactions, and how to prevent them from destroying the Space Center.

        #LOC_KSPIE_quantumGravity_title = Quantum Gravity
        #LOC_KSPIE_quantumGravity_description = Quantum gravity seeks to describe gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics on scales where quantum effects cannot be ignored.

        #LOC_KSPIE_advFusionRockets_title = Advanced Fusion Rockets
        #LOC_KSPIE_advFusionRockets_description = These rockets are going to do their best to make everything else obsolete.

        #LOC_KSPIE_specializedFusionRockets_title = Specialized Fusion Rockets
        #LOC_KSPIE_specializedFusionRockets_description = Smashing atoms together is cool, but sometimes smashing entire engines together is the path to greatness.

        #LOC_KSPIE_exoticFusionRockets_title = Exotic Fusion Rockets
        #LOC_KSPIE_exoticFusionRockets_description = We could have used fusion to power entire countries, but that power can also thrust us to Jool and beyond...

        #LOC_KSPIE_extremeFusionRockets_title = Extreme Fusion Rockets
        #LOC_KSPIE_extremeFusionRockets_description = Simulations of these fusion engines crashed the KSC computers. We hope that they will not do the same to our vessels.

        #LOC_KSPIE_extremeHighEnergyPhysics_title = Extreme High Energy Physics
        #LOC_KSPIE_extremeHighEnergyPhysics_description = Actually, HAL, I can do that!

        #LOC_KSPIE_specializedPVMaterials_title = Specialized Photovoltaic Materials
        #LOC_KSPIE_specializedPVMaterials_description = Claims that these photovoltaic materials can capture energy from even auroras or planetshine are likely exaggerated.

        #LOC_KSPIE_expPVMaterials_title = Experimental Photovoltaic Materials
        #LOC_KSPIE_expPVMaterials_description = Who am I, that the bright and morning star, would choose to light the way, for my ever-wandering vessels?

        #LOC_KSPIE_exoticPVMaterials_title = Exotic Photovoltaic Materials
        #LOC_KSPIE_exoticPVMaterials_description = Sometimes flying too close to the sun is not such a bad idea after all.

        #LOC_KSPIE_extremePVMaterials_description = For when exotic photovoltaic materials are just not enough.

        #LOC_KSPIE_extremeElectricalSystems_title = Extreme Electrical Systems
        #LOC_KSPIE_extremeElectricalSystems_description = No, it is not possible to generate power by demanding so much electricity that the energy stored would become negative.

        #LOC_KSPIE_extremeRadiators_title = Extreme Heat Management
        #LOC_KSPIE_extremeRadiators_description = With great power comes great responsibility for managing the resulting heat.
